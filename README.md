# JiggleSoft's Microchip PIC Assembler Libraries

## Introduction
Microchip has abruptly phased out the assember MPASM in favour of the PIC-AS assembler found in the XC toolchains. The decision to fall in-line with Microchips supported direction has been undertaken for our new development. This has made it necessary to migrate some of our existing projects, source, libraries, and include files, etc. developed for MPASM or to create some new ones to support the XC toolchains PIC-AS assembler.

Some of this work has been provided with permission to release it under alternative licensing, thus this repository was born.
