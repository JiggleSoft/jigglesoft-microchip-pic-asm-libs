# JiggleSoft's Microchip XC8 PIC Assembler Common Language Library.

This is a member of the 'JiggleSoft's Microchip PIC Assembler Libraries' project container.

## Introduction
Microchip has abruptly phased out the assember MPASM in favour of the PIC-AS assembler found in the XC toolchains.
The decision to fall in-line with Microchips supported direction has been undertaken for our new development.
This has made it necessary to migrate some of our existing projects, source, libraries, and include files, etc. developed for MPASM or to create some new ones to support the XC toolchains PIC-AS assembler.

Some of this work has been provided with permission to release it under alternative licensing, thus this repository was born.

This Project contains the XC8 pic-as include file that provides compatible MPASM pseudo instructions.
The pseudo instructions are case sensitive, all uppercase, inline with our coding conventions.
If there was a need a version could be made available with either upper, lower, or both cases.
